Sample model generated with GenMyModel.

Model is accessible at [GenMyModel](http://repository.genmymodel.com/will.mitchell/sample-model-with-access-control-and-orders/defaultDiagram/_aokk4sTyEeSII650IQ0Z1w)

Currently does not build because:

 - it is a non-trivial model that probably contains a syntax or semantic error somewhere
 - who has time to debug a generated JPA model?

Wouldn't it be easier to just declare the model via SQL DDL and then just generate the JOOQ data access code?
